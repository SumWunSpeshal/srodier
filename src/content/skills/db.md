title: Databases

  short: Stateless apps are the best but from time to time you need to store things.

    This section won't be too long, I promise. Coming from a traditional frontend background, it took some time for me to truly own the database I was using.

    I am priviliged enough to have entered the space at a time where raw-dogging SQL wasn't strictly necessary anymore. My database of choice was previously
    Postgres through Supabase -- always using Prisma as the ORM. 

    Currently, I am working on a project using Postgres on Heroku, still with Prisma. My experiences encompass using databases exclusively as PaaS. 
    I prefer not to manage the database on-prem. Smarter people have figured this stuff out long before me.
