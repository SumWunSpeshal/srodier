title: Styling

  short: Everyone writes it but only few learn it.

    Everybody knows CSS, right? "It's just a selector and key/value pairs" I hear you say. Right up until that grid-layout becomes an unhinged mess that
    nobody wants to touch. I strive for a codebase quality where CSS is not reduced to an append-only language because nobody understands or can keep track
    of the applied styling in a given project. Own your CSS and treat it like the first-class citizen it deserves to be.

    CSS was my first web development love and I always obsessed over understanding the intricacies of layout algorithms and using bleeding edge features as 
    soon as they came out.

    I have learned to use preprocessors very early in my career, going even as far as prototyping my own preprocessor to get a feel of the complexity behind it.

    All paradigms and tools that have emerged over the past ~5 years have landed in one or more of my projects, in search of the perfect one to rule them all. 
    Going from traditional preprocessors like Sass and Less, to a plugin-based system using PostCSS and finally the rise of atomic CSS with tools like Tailwind
    -- the CSS space has never been this exciting before.
