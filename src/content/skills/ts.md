    I have been building client-side and server-side applications using TS since around 2019.
    Ranging from vanilla TypeScript projects that output an `app.js` meant for the browser to APIs, backends and frontend frameworks that support it natively --
    TypeScript has been my programming language of choice since I learned about it. 

    Coming from a purely "HTML/CSS and some jQuery sprinkled on top" background, TypeScript has enabled me to learn my craft a lot faster and has kickstarted
    my endeavors into other environments than the browser, including node.js.
