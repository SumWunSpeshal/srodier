  short: Can't have a modern web app without overengineering the presentational layer

    Initially, the professional projects I worked on were classic PHP-driven websites. 
    The frontend consisted of embracing whatever templating language the CMS tool provided and bolting a stylesheet and a bundled JS file on top.

    Fortunately, times have changed and frontend development got appropriate tooling. 
    First as single page applications that fetched any data using APIs exclusively on the client-side, 
    and now we even get to build entire full-stack applications in JavaScript.

    My first encounter in the vast field of frontend frameworks was Angular. 
    While not my favourite framework, I still owe it all the transactional knowledge about state management and reactive programming that proved itself useful later on in my career. 

    I later got the opportunity to work professionally on projects using Gatsby, Next.js, React.js+Vite, nuxt, Svelte, Sveltekit and with this very website finally with Astro❤️.
