    Applications belong in the cloud nowadays. Therefore, my experience lies in clicking through dashboards and using CLIs of various hosting providers.
    If Vercel can do it, that will be my first consideration. The others I have worked with professionally are Heroku and Supabase. 
    I prefer serverless environments and am still looking for a project to deploy at the edge.

    If a project needs a bit of CI/CD goodness, I get by editing some Github Actions quite ok.

    I like working in Linux for personal use and during development but have previously avoided managing the webserver and would rather keep it that way.
