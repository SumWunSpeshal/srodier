description:
  short: Digital Agency in Hanover working primarily with Typo3 and Magento
  long: |
    This place is where I finished my apprenticeship and continued working for a year after. My main role was frontend development on Typo3 projects. 
    A couple of the projects I am still proud of leading the development for are [Pflegenetz](https://www.pflegenetz-diakonie-hannover.de/), [LVN](https://www.landesverkehrswacht.de/) and 
    [HGZ](https://www.hgz-bb.de/).

    I also contributed to projects like [inTime](https://www.intime.de/) and [corny](https://www.corny.de/).

    There are two projects I am particularly fond of that are internal tools of the clients we worked with and therefore, can't show you unfortunately.
    One of them is a product configurator mainly used to calculate prices
    but also had the requirement to work offline through service workers, include authentication and manage roles.
    The other one is a simple image editing tool that helps with quickly creating CI-compliant social media postings.
