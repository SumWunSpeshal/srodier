    Amazing place to work at. Neoskop is mostly split into dedicated project teams that are very specialized in fulfilling their client's specific requirements.

    I had the opportunity to work on a highly dynamic call center application that was used to enrich existing client data. 
    I also got assigned deep refactoring work for the frontend layer of the entire application stack -- all built with Angular.

    Later on, I lead the development for a brand new client website forming a central entry point for the client's services and offerings 
    using Next.js and Contentful.
